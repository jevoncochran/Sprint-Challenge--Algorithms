#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I'm honestly really not sure but I think this algorithm would always require a lesser number of operations when compared with the input size. So I think this would have a runtime of O(logn).


b) The outer loop would have an O(n) runtime and then the inner loop would have a linear runtime as well. So altogether, that would make the runtime for this algorithm translate to O(n*n) or O(n^2).


c) Seems like this algorithm would have an O(n) runtime because there aren't any loops or anything like that. Just passing in a number (n) that will elicit n number of operations. 

## Exercise II
